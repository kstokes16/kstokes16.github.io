        <p>My name is Kevin Stokes and I was born and raised in Florida. I graduated from the University of Florida in May of 2014 with a bachelor's degree in Marketing and a minor in Mass Communication.</p>
            
        <p>My career goal is to become a freelance marketer who can handle website design, copywriting, graphic design, SEO and more. I own a domain for my marketing side hustle and I like to think I am well on my way to success.</p>
        
        <p>For now, this website displays the skills and knowledge I have gained while working on front-end web development. Stay tuned to see where it could lead.</p>

        <p>When I am not coding, you can find me working at Command Investigations, a private investigation company in Lake Mary, Florida. I've worked at Command since the beginning of 2016, and I am a member of the digital marketing and sales team. </p>

        <p>In my free time I enjoy doing anything fitness related, cooking (meal prepping), watching sports and listening to music. I am a big fan of marketing and personal development books, and I enjoy all things related to Adobe Creative Cloud.</p>
